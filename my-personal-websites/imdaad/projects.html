                <h2>Summer Clothing Drive</h2>
                <p>After the successful Winter Clothing drive, Imdaad scaled up its efforts to provide the underprivileged with clothing, with the "Summer Clothing Drive". This project aimed to provide clothing for the needy people. Clothing articles were distributed in orphanages and old age homes.</p>
            
            
                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>A staggering total of 2000 clothing articles were packed carefully by the Imdaad team and these articles were distributed in orphanges and old homes (places where people are likely not being provided with the basic necessity of clothing). That is why our team made an effort to provide people in these locations with clothing articles.<br><strong>The Imdaad team made sure that none of the clothing articles had any defects and each article was packed with love and care.</strong></p>

                <h2>Prjoect Furry Friends</h2>
                <p>Meals were prepared for stray animals such as cats and dogs. The meals were prepared after our team's research that these meals are safe to be consumed by the stray animals. Our packages for dogs included store-bought dog food along with eggs and yoghurt, on the other hand, the packages for cats included store-bought cat food and yoghurt. These boxes of meals were placed with an open lid in areas where many stray cats and dogs were found.</p>
            
            
                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>Over 200 boxes were placed in different locations of the city where the animals could easily reach them. This activity was definately entertaining for us, and the animals hopefully.</p>
